  etay = 0.0033 ! A vertical-dispersion like quantity that adds
                ! vertical excitation to the diffusion matrix Bbar.
                ! Used to generate vertical emittance in ideal lattices.
                ! etay=0.0033 generates about 10 pm vertical emittance
                ! in the dc12c lattice.

  include_ibs = .true. !if true, then simulate IBS.  Else, only SR damping and excitation.
  current = 0.001  !current in amps
  tail_cut = .true.  !If true, then apply tail cut.

  !these are initial guesses for the emittance.  If these are close to the actual values
  ! then the simulation will converge quicker.  Perhaps a good way to set these
  ! is to first simulate the lattice with a Twiss based method such as Bjorken & Mtingwa's.

  !This simulation does not check for convergence.  Rather, it runs for nturns then stops.
  !The progress is recorded in emit_vs_turn.out.  It is suggested that the user watch
  ! emit_vs_turn.out to judge when the simulation has converged.
  nturns = 40000 !check emit_vs_turn.out for convergence.

  ! bend_slice_length is the maximum size of a bend slice.  slice_length is the maximum length
  ! of all other elements.
  bend_slice_length = 0.01 !smaller values improve accuracy of synchrotron radiaiont calcs and IBS.
  slice_length = 0.1 !smaller values improve accuracy of IBS (SR calc is indifferent).
