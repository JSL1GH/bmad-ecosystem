The code in the util_programs/photonic_surface_plot directory is used for:
	1) Generating a data file of surface points for a Bmad lattice element.
  2) Generating a 3D plot of the surface using the data file and gnuplot.

------------------------------
1) Generating the surface data

The program is photonic_surface_data.f90.
This program is built with the standard Bmad Distribution.
To run use the syntax:
	photonic_surface_data <init_file>
where <init_file> is the name of the initialization file containing the parameters needed by the
program to generate the data file.

An example input file is in example/photonic_surface_data.init .
To run with this file, use the following command in the example directory:
	photonic_surface_data photonic_surface_data.init

This example input file is self documenting look in this file for details.

The resulting data file looks like:

#     Ix      Iy          X               Y                 Z
     -25     -10      -3.50987227E-02  -2.12821053E-02   2.66263866E-08
     -25      -9      -3.50987227E-02  -1.91538948E-02   1.21422273E-05
     -25      -8      -3.50987227E-02  -1.70256842E-02   4.84936425E-05
     -25      -7      -3.50987227E-02  -1.48974737E-02   1.09094709E-04

There are 5 columns.
The first two columns give indexes ix and iy.
The last three columns give the (x, y, z) point on the surface.

------------------------------
2) Plotting the data.

The gnuplot command file is named surface_plot.gp .

This command file looks for a data file named "surface.dat" so if your data file has a different name
you will need to edit surface_plot.gp.

To run, first start gnuplot and then use the command:
	gnuplot> load "<directory>/surface_plot.gp"
where <directory> is the directory that surface_plot.gp is in.
For example, when running from the example directory, you would use:
	gnuplot> load "../surface_plot.gp"

Note: Plotted is -z (not z) so that the view of the surface is from above (and not below).
