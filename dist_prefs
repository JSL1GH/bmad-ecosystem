# dist_prefs
# ----------
#
# The variables in this file control how a distribution
# build will proceed.  It allows the user to enable and
# disable the use and building of various support libraries
# and to specify locations of 3rd-party libraries installed
# by the user whose functionality is supported by the 
# distribution code.
#
# All values should be enclosed in quotes " ".

#-----------------------------------------------------------
# Setting the variable DIST_F90_REQUEST here to the name
# of the desired Fortran compiler will allow for its use
# during the build.
#  Common options are:
#   "intel"
#   "gfortran"
# 
# If commented out, the defaults defined for a given 
# platform will be used as found in the file 
# common_env_setup.

# Set value to 'Y' to enable use of PGPLOT for distrubution
# build or 'N' to disable the use of the PGPLOT library.
#
# The PGPLOT source is actually upplied along with the 
# distribution and will be built if this variable is set.

# PLPLOT preferences:
#
# PLPLOT is not maintained as a component of the distribution
# like PGPLOT, and it is the users's responsibility to obtain
# and install that library if they wish to use it.
#
# - USE_PLPLOT
#   Set value to 'Y' to enable use of PLPLOT for 
#   distrubution build or 'N' to disable the use of the
#   PLPLOT library.
#
# - PLPLOT_LIBDIR
#   If the previous value is set to 'Y', this value should
#   be the path where the PLPLOT library file can be found
#   for linking purposes.  The file is typically an ".so"
#   file.  The directory will be the one where that file
#   is located.

# Set this to 'Y' to enable the linking of applications 
# along with the building of libraries.  Set to 'N' to 
# disable the creation of application binaries.
