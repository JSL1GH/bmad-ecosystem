# dist_prefs
# ----------
#
# The variables in this file control how a distribution
# build will proceed.  It allows the user to enable and
# disable the use and building of various support libraries
# and to specify locations of 3rd-party libraries installed
# by the user whose functionality is supported by the 
# distribution code.
#
# All values should be enclosed in quotes " ".
#-----------------------------------------------------------

#-----------------------------------------------------------
# Setting the variable DIST_F90_REQUEST here to the name
# of the desired Fortran compiler will allow for its use
# during the build.
#
#    NOTE: gfortran support is limited to version
#          4.6.x and later.
#
#  Supported options are:
#   "ifort"
#   "gfortran"
#-----------------------------------------------------------
export DIST_F90_REQUEST="gfortran"


#-----------------------------------------------------------
# Plotting preferences:
#
# Setting the variable ACC_PLOT_PACKAGE here to the name
# of the desired plotting library will allow for its use
# during the build.
#
# NOTE: The PLplot source is not included with nor 
#  	maintained as a component of the distribution.
#	It is the users's responsibility to obtain and 
#	install that library, if they wish to use it.
#
#	The PGPLOT source is actually supplied along with 
#	the distribution and will be built if this variable 
#	is set to "pgplot".
#
#  Supported options are:
#   "plplot"
#   "pgplot"
#-----------------------------------------------------------
export ACC_PLOT_PACKAGE="pgplot"


#-----------------------------------------------------------
# Setting the variable ACC_ENABLE_OPENMP here to "Y"
# will enable OpenMP support during the production build.
#
# NOTE: When compiling GSL, provided in this distribution,
#       on Mac OS 10.7 or higher, OpenMP is not supported. 
#       This is due to a bug in the Xcode 4.x supplied
#       version of gcc (i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2)
#       or in Apple's default cc complier (clang-425.0.24). 
#
#       Installing and using the MacPorts version(s) of gcc 
#       will avoid this issue (see http://macports.org).
#-----------------------------------------------------------
export ACC_ENABLE_OPENMP="N"


#-----------------------------------------------------------
# Setting the variable ACC_ENABLE_MPI here to "Y"
# will enable Open MPI support during the production build.
#
# NOTE: To enable this option, Open MPI must already be 
#       installed on your system, since the Open MPI package 
#       is not inculded in this distribution.
#-----------------------------------------------------------
export ACC_ENABLE_MPI="N"


#-----------------------------------------------------------
# Setting the variable ACC_ENABLE_GFORTRAN_OPTIMIZATION here 
# to "Y" will force gfortran -O2 optimization during the 
# production build. The default depends on how your 
# gcc/gfortran is configured.
# Type "gfortran -Q --help=optimizers -O2" to see what
# optimizations are enabled with the "-O2" flag. 
#-----------------------------------------------------------
export ACC_ENABLE_GFORTRAN_OPTIMIZATION="N"


#-----------------------------------------------------------
# Trying to make shared object libraries with a distribution generates a gmake error.
# This bug is being worked on and for now the making of shared
# object libraries is disabled. That is, static libraries will be used.
