When operating the GUI in matplotlib mode, you can specify a list of template plots to plot in matplotlib as soon as tao starts.  These templates should be listed in a file called plot.gui.init, which should be in the same directory from which you launch the gui.

plot.gui.init should have one template listed per line and absolutely nothing else on the line.  The templates listed in plot.gui.init are checked against the list of templates that tao can plot, and if a template is not recognized it is simply ignored.
