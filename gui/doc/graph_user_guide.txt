Interacting with plots in the GUI is primarily done using the toolbar along the bottom of the plotting window.

Starting from the left, the home button returns the graph to the starting view. The back button returns to the previous view of the graph, working as an undo button. The forward button undoes the effects of the back button. All of these buttons also have keyboard shortcuts, 'h' or 'r' for home, 'c' or 'left arrow' for back, and 'v' or 'right arrow' for forward.

The pan/zoom button allows panning of the graph by holding a left click on the graph and dragging the mouse around. his mode also allows zooming of the graph by holding a right click on the graph and dragging the mouse around. These actions can be restricted to the horizontal axis by holding 'x' while dragging, or the vertical axis by holding 'y'. Holding 'control' while dragging the mouse will preserve aspect ratio. Clicking on the toolbar button again will get out of this mode.

The zoom to rectangle button allows a rectangle to be selected by holding a left click on the graph and dragging the mouse, which will then fill the graph window. Holding 'x' or 'y' while selecting a rectangle will only effect the horizontal or vertical axis respectively.

The save button allows the graph window to be saved as an image file. Using 'ctrl+s' has the same effect.



If any floor plan or lat layout is present, double clicking on an element will open a window to view or edit element parameters.

Floor plans contain a slider to scale the size of elements away from the element centerline. Clicking on the slider will adjust the width of the displayed elements.
