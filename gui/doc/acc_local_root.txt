For development purposes, it is necessary to specify the directories from which certain modules should be imported, so that the most up-to-date versions may be used.
To accomplish this, set the environmental variable ACC_LOCAL_ROOT to the base directory of your local distribution.
NOTE: Until recently, this environmental variable was called ACC_LOCAL_DIR.  Currently, the gui will prefer ACC_LOCAL_ROOT over ACC_LOCAL_DIR although both are currently supported.  Support for ACC_LOCAL_DIR will be removed in the future.
