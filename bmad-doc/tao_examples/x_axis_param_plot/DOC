Example of how to display a plot with the x-axis being a lattice parameter.
In this case the lattice parameter is the reference energy.

The lattice contains a kicker named K whose field (set by bl_hkick) is constant independent of the reference energy.

This means that at the lowest energies of the scan range (set by plot%x%min in the tao.init file), the
lattice is unstable and there is no closed orbit. When Tao is run, Tao will issue error messages about this.
Ignore these messages. Tao will properly handle the low ref energy instability. If you want to get rid of these
messages, set plot%x%min to a value where the lattice is stable.
