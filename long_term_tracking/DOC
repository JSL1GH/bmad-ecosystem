Long Term Tracking Program
==========================

Input
-----

There are two input files. A "Master" input file and a lattice file. The Master input file will
specify the lattice file to use. There is optionally a third input file specifying the inital beam
particle coordinates.

For an example see the directory bsim/long_term_tracking/example

In the Master input file two structures called "bmad_com" and "beam_init" may be set. For
documentation on these structures see the Bmad manual.


Output
------

The output file records the initial and final positions of all particles tracked.
