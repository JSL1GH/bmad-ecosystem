Long Term Tracking Program
==========================

This program is for long term tracking of a particle or beam possibly including tracking of the spin

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input
-----

There are two input files. A "Master" input file and a lattice file. The Master input file will
specify the lattice file to use. There is optionally a third input file specifying the inital beam
particle coordinates.

For an example, see the directory 
	bsim/long_term_tracking/example



In the Master input file two structures called "bmad_com" and "beam_init" may be set. For
documentation on these structures see the Bmad manual.

Output
------

* end_dat_file:
This file records the initial and final positions of all particles tracked. If the file name is
blank (the default), no file will be produced.

* turn_by_turn_dat_file:
This file creates a turn-by-turn record of the track of the first particle of the bunch. 
If the file name is blank (the default), no file will be produced.

* snapshot_dat_file:
This file gives a snapshot of the beam at regular intervals determined by the setting of
snapshot_every_n_turns. A file is produced for each snapshot. If snapshot_dat_file contains
a "#" character, the name of the file used to record the beam at a given turn substitutes the
turn number for the "#" character. For example, if snapshot_dat_file = "snap#.dat", and 
snapshot_every_n_turns = 20, then the files produced will be "snap000.dat", snap020.dat", etc.
If no "#" character is found, the turn number will be simply appended to the end of the file. 
If the file name is blank (the default), no file will be produced.
