## Contributing to Bmad: Pull Requests

What is a Pull Request? A Pull Request (PR) is a mechanism for requesting that changes that you have made 
to a copy of this repository (bmad-sim/bmad-ecosystem) are integrated (merged) into this repository.

The **main** branch of bmad-ecosystem is the central branch where all changes are merged into. 

Pull Requests start with changes you have made to a branch that is not **main**. The PR is then a request for the changes you have made
to be merged with **main**. 

Your copy of the bmad-ecosystem repository can be a 
[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)
or simply a [clone](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone).
Note: The procedure for
[creating a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) 
when using a fork is somewhat different than when using a clone.
