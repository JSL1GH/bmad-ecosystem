New stuff:

reject_dead_at_det_photon1: Default False

lux_param%n_energy_pts:
	Defines the number of coherent sets
	Only used with coherent photons

explain energy binning (see lux_com%energy_bin(:))

coherent photons
	Set: lattice parameter[photon_type] = COHERENT
	stop values are per energy point

Initial photon field (x/y) will be normalized to 1.

photon_def%e_field_x and/or photon_def%e_field_y must be non-zero for a rocking curve.

Added photon_def%normalize_field [Always normalized when using random number generator]

rocking_curve: Generates photons from beginning of lattice.

source element slicing: number of slices based upon photon_init%ds_slice

det element: must set surface = {grid = {...}}

---------

To set emittance:

  \item[\vn{photon_init\%emit_x, photon_init\%emit_y}] \Newline
$x$ and $y$ charged particle beam emittances. 
Used when the photon source is a bend, wiggler, or undulator.
