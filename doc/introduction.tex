\section*{Tao: The Tool for Accelerator Optics}

Many simulation problems fall into one of three categories: 

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Design a lattice subject to various constraints.
\item
Simulate errors and changes in machine parameters. For example, you want to
simulate what happens to the orbit, beta function, etc., when you change
something in the machine. 
\item 
Simulate machine comissioning incliding simulating data measurment and
correction. For example, you want to know what steering strength changes will
make an orbit flat.
\end{itemize}
 
Programs that are written to solve these types of problems have common
elements: You have variables you want to vary in your model of your
machine, you have "data" that you want to view, and, in the first two
categories above, you want to match the machine model to the data (in
designing a lattice the constraints correspond to the data).

Because of this commonality of design, the \tao program was developed
to reduce the time needed to develop working programs. \tao is a
machine independent program that implements the essential ingredients
needed to solve simulation problems. To make the connection, \tao uses
configuration input files that can be tailored to specific
machines. Additionally, \tao has been built to be easily customizable
so that extending \tao to solve new and different problems is straight
forward.
