\section*{Introduction}

\tao stands for ``Tool for Accelerator Optics''. \tao is a general
purpose program for simulating high energy particle beams in
accelerators and storage rings. The simulation engine that \tao uses
is the \bmad software library\cite{b:bmad}. \bmad was developed as an
object-oriented library so that common tasks, such as reading in a
lattice file and particle tracking, did not have to be coded from
scratch every time someone wanted to develop a program to calculate
this, that or whatever.

After the development of \bmad, it became apparent that many simulation
programs had common needs: For example, plotting data, viewing machine
parameters, etc. Because of this commonality, the \tao program was
developed to reduce the time needed to develop a working programs
without sacrificing flexibility. That is, while the ``vanilla''
version of the \tao program is quite a powerful simulation tool, \tao
has been designed to be easily customizable so that extending \tao to
solve new and different problems is relatively straight forward.

This manual is divided into three parts. Part I gives an introduction
and tutorial to \tao with examples of how to set-up tracking, do plotting,
etc. Part II is the reference section which defines the terms used by
\tao and explains in detail the syntax of the configuration files that
\tao uses to make a connection with a specific machine. Finally, Part
III is a programmer's guide which shows how to extend \tao's capabilities
and incorporate custom calculations.

manual, can be found at the \bmad web site at
