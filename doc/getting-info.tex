\section{The Plotting Window}
\index{plotting}

When \tao first starts up, \tao will create a new window for
displaying plots. This window will be called the \vn{plot}
window. Commands to \tao can be typed in from the original window from
which \tao was invoked. This will be called the \vn{command} window.

As a first step, let us command \tao to display some plotting
information using the command:
\begin{example}
  show plot       ! \sref{s:show}
\end{example}
The information will be displayed in the command window. The first
section of the \vn{show plot} output shows information on font sizes:
\begin{example}
  plot_page parameters:
  %size                       =   400  500
  %n_curve_pts                =   401
  %text_height                = 12.000
  %main_title_text_scale      = 1.300
  %graph_title_text_scale     = 1.100
  %axis_number_text_scale     = 0.900
  %axis_label_text_scale      = 1.000
  %key_table_text_scale       = 0.900
  %legend_text_scale          = 0.800
\end{example}
See section~\sref{s:init.plot} for more details. 

The second section of the \vn{show plot} output
lists the plot \vn{templates} (\sref{c:plotting}) and
\sref{s:template}) that \tao knows about:
\begin{example}
 Templates:
   Plot                .Graph
   ------------------  ----------
   orbit               .x  .y
   phase               .a  .b
   beta                .a  .b
   eta                 .x  .y
   cbar                .22  .12  .11
   quad_k1             .k1
   floor               .this
\end{example}
In this case, these templates are defined in the \vn{tao_plot.init}
file. There is an \vn{orbit} plot template which has two associated
graphs: \vn{orbit.x} and \vn{orbit.y}, etc. To see more information on, for example,
the \vn{phase} template plot, use the command
\begin{example}
  show plot phase
\end{example}
and to see more information on, for example, the \vn{orbit.y} graph use the command
\begin{example}
  show plot orbit.y
\end{example}
Similarly, the \vn{show plot} command can be used to display
information about the curves within each graph.

The next block of information in the \vn{show plot} command is:
\begin{example}
  Plot Region         <-->  Plot                 x1    x2    y1    y2
  -----------               -----------------------------------------
  top                 <-->  orbit               0.00  1.00  0.48  0.95
  bottom              <-->  phase               0.00  1.00  0.00  0.48
\end{example}
This shows that two plot regions have been defined called \vn{top} and
\vn{bottom}. The \vn{top} plot contains an \vn{orbit} plot and
the \vn{bottom} region contains a betatron \vn{phase} plot.

Figure~\ref{f:plot.begin} shows what you will see in the plot
window. In the top two plots you see the \vn{x} and \vn{y} model
lattice orbit data. The horizontal axis is the \cesr BPM index. The
horizontal pretzel and L03 vertical bump in CESR can be clearly
seen. The slight vertical displacement due to the solenoid
compensation can also be seen around the IP. The orbit data is for a
closed orbit electron (this being a storage ring). The bottom two
plots show the relative particle phase, that is, the difference
between the model and design phases (as documented in the plot title
as [model - design]). Two plot regions are defined in \tao
\vn{top} and \vn{bottom}.

To see information on, say, the orbit plot, use the command
\begin{example}
  show plot orbit
\end{example}
This shows:
\begin{example}
  Region:  orbit
  Plot:  orbit
  x_axis_type          = index
  x%label              =
  x%max                =   1.00000000E+02
  x%min                =   0.00000000E+00
  x%major_div          =       10
  x%major_div_nominal  =       10
  x%places             =       -1
  x%draw_label         = T
  x%draw_numbers       = T
  autoscale_x          = F
  autoscale_y          = F
  autoscale_gang_x     = T
  autoscale_gang_y     = T
  Graphs:
     x
     y
\end{example}
Also see the \vn{show graph} and \vn{show curve} commands.

\index{commands!plot}
Let's view the absolute model phase. Use the command:
\begin{example}
  plot bottom model
\end{example}
This will change the data plotted in the bottom two graphs to just the
model.  The plots are now way off scale. Let \tao automatically set
the scale by typing:
\index{commands!scale}
\begin{example}
  scale bottom
\end{example}
As expected, the phase increases approximately linearly as the
particle travels through the ring. Zero phase is halfway through the
ring (at L03 in \cesr lingo).  This is always true. Absolute phase is
arbitrary so \tao sets the average phase to zero when generating the
data. To set this back to relative phase type:
\begin{example}
  plot bottom model - design
\end{example}

Let's now look at the beta function by typing
\index{commands!place}
\begin{example}
  place bottom beta
\end{example}
Again, we need to rescale the plots by typing
\index{commands!scale}
\begin{example}
  scale bottom
\end{example}
We see the periodic FODO beta function where large horizontal beta
corresponds to small vertical beta and vice versa.

Likewise, we can look at the dispersion in the top two graphs by
typing
\index{commands!scale}
\begin{example}
  place top eta
  scale top
\end{example}
The plot window should now look like Figure~\ref{f:plot.eta.beta}.

Now let's look at the coupling (C-matrix) by typing
\begin{example}
  place bottom cbar
  scale bottom
\end{example}
We see that there is strong coupling within the CLEO solenoid and
virtually no coupling anywhere else. To zoom in the scale so that we
can see the residual coupling outside the interaction region type
\begin{example}
  scale bottom -0.01 0.01
\end{example}
The \vn{**Limited**} displayed in red on the bottom plots tells us
that there are data points outside the plotted region.  We now see
that there is a small amount of coupling at the L03 region (BPM
indexes 45-55) and a few other places along the ring. Your plot window
should now look like Figure~\ref{f:plot.coupling.no.IR}.

The x-axis is currently the BPM index number. It is sometimes
convenient to plot the data versus longitudinal position. This is done
by typing
\index{commands!x-axis}
\begin{example}
  x-axis * s
\end{example}

The \cmd{all} will apply the change to all plot areas (both top and
bottom). In any of the above commands \cmd{top} or \cmd{bottom} could
have been replaced with \cmd{all}.

Variables can also be plotted provided the proper plot template has
been set up in the plot initialization file (See
Section~\sref{s:init.plot} for details on initializing plotting). Type
the following to view the quadrupole k1 values:
\begin{example}
  place bottom quad_k1
\end{example}
\index{commands!plot}
\index{commands!place}

\section{The Show Command}

Anything in the super-universe can be displayed using the \cmd{show}
command (\sref{s:show}). To get a list of the data elements currently
defined in \tao type
\index{commands!show}
\begin{example}
  show data
\end{example}
the output should look like:
\begin{example}
  Name                                   Using for Optimization

  orbit.x[0:99]
  orbit.y[0:99]

  phase.a[0:99]
  phase.b[0:99]

  eta.x[0:99]
  eta.y[0:99]

  beta.a[0:99]
  beta.b[0:99]

  cbar.11[0:99]
  cbar.12[0:99]
  cbar.21[0:99]
  cbar.22[0:99]

  k.11b[0:99]
  k.12a[0:99]
  k.12b[0:99]
  k.22a[0:99]
\end{example}
There are six \vn{d2} data types (\sref{s:data.org}) defined in the
initialization file: \vn{orbit}, \vn{phase}, etc.  The \vn{beta} data is further
subdivided into two \vn{d1} data arrays labeled \vn{beta.a} and \vn{beta.b}.
Each of these arrays has 100 data points indexed from 0 to 99.

The \vn{``Using for Optimization''} column is blank indicating that no data
would be used in an optimization (\sref{c:opti}).

To see the data values for the horizontal beta function for \cesr BPMs
1 through 50 type
\begin{example}
  show data beta.a[1:50]
\end{example}
Since we haven't changed any elements in the lattice yet the model
values equal the design values. Also note that \vn{beta.a} is actually
the a-mode betatron function. In regions with little or no coupling,
the a-mode is almost completely in the horizontal plane.

A significant point: The convention in \bmad is to label the twiss
parameters as \vn{x} and \vn{y} but they are actually the \vn{a} and
\vn{b} normal modes. So in regions of strong coupling \vn{beta.a} does
not correspond to \vn{orbit.x} which is always in the true horizontal
lab frame.  However, if you wish, you can re-label your twiss data
planes as \vn{a} and \vn{b}.  Section~\ref{c:init} shows you how to do
this. Keep in mind that lattice twiss parameters are defined
\textit{only for uncoupled betatron motion} so this is all that is
provided as data types for single particle tracking.  However, true
lab-frame \vn{x} and \vn{y} twiss parameters can be defined for a
distribution of particles so for beam
tracking true lab-frame \vn{x} and \vn{y} twiss parameters can be
calculated and are provided as data types for those tracking
types. See the \bmad manual for how to convert from normal mode
coordinates to lab-frame coordinates.

This tutorial uses single particle tracking and the twiss parameters
are found about the orbit of the tracked particle. There is another
tracking type called particle beam tracking. This
tracking type will not be explored in this tutorial.

You can also view variables by typing
\begin{example}
  show var
\end{example}
To view the quadrupole k1 values for \cesr quadrupoles 5 and 20
through 30 type
\begin{example}
  sho var quad\_k1[5,20:30]
\end{example}
Again, since we haven't changed any quadrupoles the model values are
all at their design values.

You can also see the details of a particular lattice element. To view
the details for quadrupole Q05W type
\begin{example}
  sho ele Q05W
\end{example}

\vn{show var} and \vn{show ele} show two completely different types of
structures in \tao. Elements are the actual lattice elements as known
to \bmad.  Variables are native \tao structures that act kind of like
\bmad \textit{overlays} and only indirectly control the lattice
elements.

A list of lattice elements between two elements can be shown by typing 
\begin{example}
  sho lattice 0:20
\end{example}
This will show a list of all the lattice elements between and
including elements 0 and 20. Twiss parameters and orbit information, at
the exit end of each element, is also shown.

Anything printed to the display using the \vn{show} command can also
be printed to a file by typing
\begin{example}
  show -write <file_name> <what_to_show>
\end{example}
\index{commands!show}

A list of all intrinsic \vn{tao} commands can be found by typing
\index{commands!help}
\begin{example}
  help
\end{example}
This will not list any custom commands. Detailed help on any
individual command can be found with
\begin{example}
  help <command\_name>
\end{example}
where \vn{<command_name>} is the command you want help with.
