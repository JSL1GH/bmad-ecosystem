Tao: The Tool for Accelerator Optics

Many simulation problems fall into one of three categories: 

<ul>

<li> You want to design a lattice subject to various constraints.

<li> You have some measured data and you want to make a correction. For
example, you want to know what steering strength changes will make an orbit
flat.

<li> You want to simulate what happens to the orbit, beta function,
etc., when you change something in the machine.

</ul>


<p>
Programs that are written to solve these types of problems have common
elements: You have variables you want to vary in your model of your
machine, you have "data" that you want to view, and, in the first two
categories above, you want to match the machine model to the data (in
designing a lattice the constraints correspond to the data).

<p>
Because of this commonality of design, the Tao program was developed
to reduce the time needed to develop working programs. Tao is a
machine independent program that implements the essential ingredients
needed to solve simulation problems. To make the
connection, Tao uses configuration input files that can be tailored to
specific machines. Additionally, Tao has been built
to be easily customizable so that extending Tao to solve new and
different problems is relatively straight forward.

<p>
The Tao manual covers the physics, input file formats, and programming
Tao extensions.

<h2>Running Tao:</h2> 

For Non-Cornell people, Tao comes with the Bmad
distribution (see the <a href = "obtaining.html">Obtaining Bmad</a>
web page).

<p>
At Wilson Lab, each software <a href = "overview.html">release</a>
contains an executable. See the <a href =
"local_setup.html">Local_Setup</a> page on how to run Tao.

<p>
To get example input files for Tao use the command:
<pre>
  svn co https://accserv.lepp.cornell.edu/svn/trunk/src/tao/program
</pre>
This will create a sub-directory called <b>program</b> in your local
directory which contains the input files. Go to that directory and
run Tao:
<pre>
  cd program
  $ACC_EXE/tao
</pre>

<h2>The Wisdom Tao:</h2> 

As told to <a href="http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/tao-of-programming.html">Geoffrey James</a>:

<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
<img style="vertical-align:bottom" src = "yin-yang.jpeg" width = "15" height = "15">
In the beginning was the Tao. The Tao gave birth to Space and
Time. Therefore Space and Time are Yin and Yang of programming.</p>

<p>Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out
of time and space for their programs. Programmers that comprehend the
Tao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals.</p>

<p>How could it be otherwise?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
<img style="vertical-align:bottom" src = "yin-yang.jpeg" width = "15" height = "15">
Thus spake the master programmer:</p>
<p>After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
<img style="vertical-align:bottom" src = "yin-yang.jpeg" width = "15" height = "15">
A novice asked the master: I have a program that sometime
runs and sometimes aborts. I have followed the rules of programming,
yet I am totally baffled. What is the reason for this?</p>

<p>The master replied: You are confused because you do not
understand Tao.  Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow
humans. Why do you expect it from a machine that humans have
constructed? Computers simulate determinism; only Tao is perfect.</p>

<p>The rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is
eternal. Therefore you must contemplate Tao before you receive
enlightenment.</p>

<p>But how will I know when I have received enlightenment? asked the novice.</p>

<p>Your program will then run correctly, replied the master.</p>

<img style="vertical-align:bottom" src = "yin-yang.jpeg" width = "15" height = "15">
A novice asked the Master: Here is a programmer that never
designs, documents or tests his programs.  Yet all who know him
consider him one of the best programmers in the world.  Why is
this?</p>

<p>The Master replies: That programmer has mastered the Tao.
He has gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when
the system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has
gone beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone
else sees his code.  He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of
his programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their
purpose self-evident.  Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao</p>
