<h1>Tao: The Tool for Accelerator Optics</h1>
</center>


Many simulation problems fall into one of three categories: 

<ul>

<li> You want to design a lattice subject to various constraints.

<li> You have some measured data and you want to make a correction. For
example, you want to know what steering strength changes will make an orbit
flat.

<li> You want to simulate what happens to the orbit, beta function,
etc., when you change something in the machine.

</ul>


<p>
Programs that are written to solve these types of problems have common
elements: You have variables you want to vary in your model of your
machine, you have "data" that you want to view, and, in the first two
categories above, you want to match the machine model to the data (in
designing a lattice the constraints correspond to the data).

<p>
Because of this commonality of design, the Tao program was developed
to reduce the time needed to develop working programs. Tao is a
machine independent program that implements the essential ingredients
needed to solve simulation problems. To make the
connection, Tao uses configuration input files that can be tailored to
specific machines. Additionally, Tao has been built
to be easily customizable so that extending Tao to solve new and
different problems is relatively straight forward.

<p>
The Tao manual covers the physics, input file formats, and programing
of Tao. The Tao manual comes in PS and PDF versions:
<ul> 
<li> <a href = "tao-manual-RRR.pdf">tao-manual-RRR.pdf</a> -- Revised: DDD
<li> <a href = "tao-manual-RRR.ps">tao-manual-RRR.ps</a> -- Revised: DDD
</ul>

<h3>Running Tao:</h3> 

For Non-Cornell people, Tao comes with the Bmad
distribution (see the <a href = "obtaining.html">Obtaining Bmad</a>
web page).

<p>
At Wilson Lab, each software <a href = "overview.html">release</a>
contains an executable. See the <a href =
"local_setup.html">Local_Setup</a> page on how to run Tao.

<p>
To get example input files for Tao use the command:
<pre>
  svn co https://accserv.lepp.cornell.edu/svn/trunk/src/tao/program
</pre>
This will create a sub-directory called <b>program</b> in your local
directory which contains the input files. Go to that directory and
run Tao:
<pre>
  cd program
  $ACC_EXE/tao
</pre>
