%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PTC/FPP (Polymorphic Tracking Code / Fully Polymorphic Package)
library of Etienne Forest handles Taylor maps to any arbitrary
order. this is also known as Truncated Power Series Algebra
(TPSA). The core Differential Algebra (DA) package used by PTC was
developed by Martin Berz\cite{b:berz}.  For more information see the
FPP/PTC manual\cite{b:ptc}.

\section{Accessing PTC}
\label{s:ptc.structures}

\bmad uses a \vn{lat_struct} structure to hold the information on a
machine and a \vn{lat_struct} has an array of \vn{branch_struct}s with
each \vn{branch_struct} holding an array of \vn{ele_struct}s. The
\vn{ele_struct} holds the information on the individual elements. An
\vn{ele_struct} holds information about both the physical element and
the reference orbit through it.

PTC has a somewhat different philosopy as illustrated in
\fig{f:ptc-struct}. A PTC \vn{layout} structure is roughly equivalent
to a \bmad \vn{branch_struct}. A \vn{layout} has a pointer to a linked
list of \vn{fibre} structures. Each \vn{fibre} has a pointer to a
\vn{magnet} structure which holds the information about the physical
element and each \vn{fibre} holds information about the reference
orbit through the element.

\section{Phase Space}
\label{s:ptc.space}
\index{PTC/FPP!phase space}

PTC uses different longitudinal phase space coordinates compared to \bmad.
\bmad's phase space coordinates are (\sref{s:phase.space})
\Begineq
  (x, p_x, y, p_y, z, p_z)
\Endeq
In PTC one can choose between several different coordinate systems. The one
that Bmad uses is 
\Begineq
  (x, p_x, y, p_y, p_t, c \Delta t)
\Endeq
where
\Begineq
  p_t = \frac{\Delta E}{P_0}
\Endeq
This choice of phase space is set in \Hyperref{r:set.ptc}{set_ptc}.  Specificially,
the PTC global variable \vn{DEFAULT}, which is of type
\vn{internal_states}, has the \vn{%time} switch set to \vn{True}.

\vn{vec_bmad_to_ptc} and \vn{vec_ptc_to_bmad} are conversion routines
that translate between the two. Actually there are a number of
conversion routines that translate between \bmad and PTC
structures. See \sref{r:ptc} for more details.

Simplified diagram showing the organization of the major PTC
structures involved in defining a lattice contrasted with \bmad. With
PTC, The top level structure is an array of \vn{layout_array}
structures. Each \vn{layout_array} holds a \vn{layout} structure. A
\vn{layout} structure has pointers to the previous and next
\vn{layout}s making a linked list of \vn{layout}s indicated by the
horizontal arrows. Each layout has pointers to a linked list of
\vn{fibre} structures. The \vn{fibre} structures represent the
reference trajectory through an element. Each \vn{fibre} structure has
a pointer to a \vn{element} and an \vn{elementp} structures which
represent the physical element. With \bmad, the \vn{lat_struct}
roughly corresponds to the PTC \vn{layout_array(:)}, the
\vn{branch_struct} roughly corresponds to the PTC \vn{layout} and the
\vn{element_struct} roughly corresponds to the PTC \vn{fibre},
\vn{element} and \vn{elementp} structures.

\section{Initialization}
\label{s:ptc.init}
\index{PTC/FPP!initialization}

One important parameter in PTC is the order of the Taylor maps.
By default \bmad will set this to 3. The order can be set within
a lattice file using the \vn{parameter[taylor_order]} attribute.
In a program the order can be set using \vn{set_ptc}. In fact
\vn{set_ptc} must be called by a program before PTC can be used.
\vn{bmad_parser} will do this when reading in a lattice file.
That is, if a program does not use \vn{bmad_parser} then to use PTC it
must call \vn{set_ptc}. Note that resetting PTC to a different order
reinitializes PTC's internal memory so one must be careful if one wants
to change the order in mid program.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Correspondence between Bmad elements and PTC fibres}.
\label{s:ele.fib}
\index{fibre}

When a PTC \vn{layout} is created from a \bmad \vn{lat_struct}
instance using the routine \Hyperref{r:lat.to.ptc.layout}{lat_to_ptc_layout}, the correspondence
between the \bmad elements and the PTC fibres is maintained through
the \vn{ele%ptc_fiber} pointer. The following rules apply:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item There will be marker \vn{fibre}s at the beginning and end 
of the \vn{layout}. The beginning \vn{fibre} will correspond to
\vn{branch%ele(0)}. The end \vn{fibre} will not have a corresponding
\bmad element.
  \item Generally there will be a one-to-one correspondence between
\vn{fibre}s and \vn{branch%ele} elements. The exception is where a
``hard edge'' model is used for tracking. In this case, there will be
three \vn{fibre}s for the \bmad element: Two drift \vn{fibre}s with a
\vn{fibre} of the appropriate type inbetween.  In this case,
\vn{ele%ptc_fiber} will point to the last (drift) \vn{fibre}.
  \end{enumerate}

Remember: The attributes like reference energy, etc. for a \bmad
\vn{ele_struct} instance are referenced to the exit end of the
element. For PTC the reference edge for a \vn{fibre} is the entrance
end.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Taylor Maps}
\label{s:ptc.taylor}
\index{PTC/FPP!Taylor Maps}

\index{PTC/FPP!real_8}\index{PTC/FPP!universal_taylor}
FPP stores its \vn{real_8} Taylor maps in such a way that it is not
easy to access them directly to look at the particular terms. To
simplify life, Etienne has implemented the
\vn{universal_taylor}structure:
\begin{example}
  type universal_taylor
    integer, pointer  :: n       ! Number of coefficients
    integer, pointer  :: nv      ! Number of variables
    real(dp), pointer :: c(:)    ! Coefficients C(N)
    integer, pointer  :: j(:,:)  ! Exponents of each coefficients J(N,NV)
  end type
\end{example}
\bmad always sets \vn{nv} = 6. \bmad overloads the equal sign to call 
routines to convert between Etienne's
\vn{real_8} Taylor maps and \vn{universal_taylor}:
\begin{example}
  type (real_8) tlr(6)           ! Taylor map
  type (universal_taylor) ut(6)  ! Taylor map
  ...
  tlr = ut                       ! Convert universal_taylor -> real_8
  ut = tlr                       ! Convert real_8 -> universal_taylor
\end{example}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Patches}
\label{s:ptc.patch}
\index{PTC/FPP!patch}

There is a significant difference between how patches are treated in
PTC and \bmad.  In PTC, a patch is just though of as a coordinate
transformation for propagating a particle from one \vn{fibre} to the
next. As such, the \vn{patch} is part of a \vn{fibre}. That is, any
\vn{fibre} representing tracking through quadrupoles, bends, etc. will
have patches for the entrance and exit ends of the \vn{fibre}.

With \bmad, on the other hand, a \vn{patch} is a ``first class''
element on par with all other elements be they quadrupoles, bends,
etc. When translating a \vn{patch} from \bmad to PTC, the \vn{patch}
is represented in PTC as a \vn{marker} element with a patch at the
exit end.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Number of Integration Steps}
\label{s:ptc.step}

``Drift like'' elements in PTC will use, by default, only one
integration step. \bmad uses the default when translating from \bmad
lattice elements to PTC fibres. The \bmad lattice elements that are
drift like are:
\begin{example}
  drift
  ecollimator 
  instrument 
  monitor 
  pipe
  rcollimator 
\end{example}
