\section{Equations of Motion}
\label{s:spin.dyn}

The propagation of the classical spin vector $\Bf S$ is described in the local reference
frame (\sref{s:ref}) by a modified Thomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi
(T-BMT) equation\cite{b:spin.hoff}
\Begineq
  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s} \Bf S = 
  \left\{ \frac{(1+\Bf r_t \dotproduct \bfg)}{c \, \beta_z} \, 
  \left( {\pmb\Omega}_{BMT} + {\pmb\Omega}_{EDM} \right) - 
  \bfg \times \bfhat z \right\} \times \mathbf{S}
  \label{tbmt}
\Endeq
where $\bfg$ is the bend curvature function which points away from the center of curvature
of the particle's reference orbit (see \fig{f:local.coords}), $\Bf r_t = (x, y)$ are the
transverse coordinates, $c \, \beta_z$ is the longitudinal component of the velocity, and
$\bfhat z$ is the unit vector in the $z$-direction. $\pmb\Omega_{BMT}$ is the usual T-BMT
precession vector due to the particle's magnetic moment and $\pmb\Omega_{EDM}$ is the
precession vector due to a finite Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) \cite{b:silenko}. Note:
The value for the EDM is set by \vn{bmad_com%electric_dipole_moment} (\sref{s:bmad.common}).
\begin{align}
  {\pmb\Omega}_{BMT} (\mathbf{r,P},t) &= 
    - \frac{q}{m \, c} \left[ 
    \left(\frac{1}{\gamma} + a \right) \, c \, \Bf B -
    \frac{a \, \gamma \, c}{1 + \gamma} \, ( \bfbeta \dotproduct \Bf B ) \, \bfbeta -
    \left( a + \frac{1}{1 + \gamma} \right) \, \mathbf{\bfbeta \times  E} 
    \right] \label{orpt} \\
  &= - \frac{q}{m \, c} \left[ 
    \left( \frac{1}{\gamma} + a \right) \, c \, \Bf B_{\perp} +
    \frac{(1 + a) \, c}{\gamma} \, \Bf B_\parallel -
    \left( a + \frac{1}{1 + \gamma} \right) \mathbf{\bfbeta \times E} 
    \right] \nonumber
\end{align}
and
\Begineq
  {\pmb\Omega}_{EDM} (\mathbf{r,P},t) = 
  - \frac{q \, \eta}{2 \, m \, c} \left[
  \Bf E - \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \, 
  ( \bfbeta \dotproduct \Bf E ) \, \bfbeta +
  c \, \mathbf{\bfbeta \times B}
  \right]
\Endeq
Here $\Bf E (\Bf r ,t)$ and $\Bf B (\Bf r ,t)$ are the electric and magnetic fields, $\Bf B_\perp$
and $\Bf B_\parallel$ are the components perpendicular and parallel to the particle's momentum,
$\gamma$ is the particle's relativistic gamma factor, $q$, and $m$ are the particle's charge and
mass, $\bfbeta$ is the normalized velocity, $a = (g-2)/2$ is the particle's anomalous gyro-magnetic
moment (values given in Table~\ref{t:constants}), and $\eta$ is the normalized electric dipole
moment which is related to the dipole moment $\Bf d$ via
\Begineq
  \Bf d = \frac{\eta}{2} \, \frac{q}{m \, c} \, \Bf S
\Endeq
Note: Some authors define $\eta$ without the factor of $c$ is the denominator.

It is important to keep in mind that the $a$ and $g$-factors used here are defined using \Eq{mgq2m}
which, in the case of nuclei and other composite baryonic particles, differs from the conventional
definition \Eq{mgq2m2}. See the discussion after \Eq{mgq2m}.

\section{Quaternion Representation of Spin Rotations}
\label{s:quat}

\bmad uses a quaternion representation for spin rotations. The following is a brief introduction to
quaternions. For more information, the reader is referred to the Web. In particular, the
\vn{Quaternions and spatial rotation} article at \vn{wikipedia.org}. 

A quaternion $\bfq$ is a 4-vector $\bfq = (q_1, q_x, q_y, q_z)$ where the components are reals if they represent a
rotation and are Taylor series if they represent a rotation map (\sref{s:spin.map}). A quaternion can
also be represented in the form:
\Begineq
  \bfq = q_1 + q_x \, \cali + q_y \, \calj + q_z \calk
  \label{qqqqq}
\Endeq
where $\cali$, $\calj$, and $\calk$ are the {\em fundamental quaternion units} with the properties
\Begineq
  \cali^2 = \calj^2 = \calk^2 = \cali \, \calj \, \calk = -1, \quad 
  \cali \, \calj = \calk, \quad \calj \, \cali = -\calk, \quad \text{etc.}
\Endeq
$\cali$, $\calj$, and $\calk$ do not commute among themselves but do commute with real numbers.

The $q_1$ component of a quaternion is called the \vn{real} (or sometimes \vn{scalar}) part and the other
three components are called the \vn{imaginary} (or sometimes \vn{vector}) part.

When a quaternion represents a rotation, $\cali$, $\calj$, and $\calk$ can be thought of as representing unit
vectors along the three Cartesian axes $\bfx$, $\bfy$, and $\bfz$ respectively. A rotation through an angle
$\theta$ around the unit axis $\bfu = (u_x, u_y, u_z)$ is represented by the quaternion
\Begineq
  \bfq = \cos\frac{\theta}{2} + (u_x \, \cali + u_y \, \calj + u_z \, \calk) \sin\frac{\theta}{2}
  \label{qt2ui}
\Endeq

A rotation quaternion $\bfq$ has normalization 1:
\Begineq
  1 = ||\bfq|| = \sqrt{q_1^2 + q_x^2 + q_y^2 + q_z^2}
\Endeq
Such a quaternion is called a \vn{unit} quaternion.
The quaternion conjugate $\bfq^*$ is defined by
\Begineq
  \bfq^* = q_1 - q_x \, \cali - q_y \, \calj - q_z \calk
\Endeq
and the inverse $\bfq^{-1}$ is given by
\Begineq
  \bfq^{-1} = \frac{\bfq^*}{||\bfq||^2}
\Endeq

Given an ordinary spatial vector $(\bfr_x, \bfr_y, \bfr_z)$, this vector is represented by a
quaternion $\bfr = (0, \bfr_x, \bfr_y, \bfr_z)$. The rotation of $\bfr$ through a rotation
represented by quaternion $\bfq$ to position $\bfr'$ is given by
\Begineq
  \bfr' = \bfq \, \bfr \, \bfq^*
  \label{rqrq}
\Endeq
The transformation matrix corresponding to the transformation of \Eq{rqrq} is
\Begineq
  \bfR = \begin{pmatrix}
    q_1^2 + q_x^2 - q_y^2 - q_z^2    & 2 \, q_x \ q_y - 2 \, q_1 \, q_z & 2 \, q_x \ q_z + 2 \, q_1 \, q_y \\
    2 \, q_x \ q_y + 2 \, q_1 \, q_z & q_1^2 - q_x^2 + q_y^2 - q_z^2    & 2 \, q_y \ q_z - 2 \, q_1 \, q_x \\
    2 \, q_x \ q_z - 2 \, q_1 \, q_y & 2 \, q_y \ q_z + 2 \, q_1 \, q_x & q_1^2 - q_x^2 - q_y^2 + q_z^2 
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{rqqq}
\Endeq

In quaternion notation, two rotations $\bfq_1$ and $\bfq_2$ are combined into one rotation using the formula
\Begineq
  \bfq_{12} = \bfq_2 \, \bfq_1
\Endeq
where $\bfq_{12}$ is the result of rotation $\bfq_1$ followed by $\bfq_2$. Note that this equation
is analogous to how rotation matrices are combined (for more information see \cite{b:quat}).

%-----------------------------------------------------------------   
\section{Invariant Spin Field}
\label{s:isf}

In a storage ring, the \vn{invariant spin field} $\bfn(\bfr, s)$
\cite{b:spin.hoff,b:duan15}, at some phase space position $\bfr = (x, p_x, y, p_y, z, p_z)$ and at
some point $s$ in the ring, is the continuous function with unit amplitude that satisifies
\Begineq
  \bfn(\Cal M_r \bfr, s) = \Cal M_s(\bfr) \, \bfn(\bfr, s)
  \label{nmrs}
\Endeq
where $\Cal M_r$ is the orbital part of the 1-turn transfer map and $\Cal M_s(\bfr)$ is the spin
part of the map which is a function of $\bfr$. In general, it is not straightforward to calculate
$\bfn$. The exceptional case (besides the cases where there is a resonance) is if the particle is on
the closed orbit $\bfr_0$. In this case, since $\Cal M_r \bfr_0 = \bfr_0$, and since $\Cal M_s(\bfr)$
is a rotation matrix, \Eq{nmrs} can be solved to give the invariant spin field on the closed orbit
which is denoted $\bfn_0$.

Once the invariant spin field has been calculated, various quantities of interest can be
computed. For example, given some initial distribution of spins in a beam, the maximum possible time
averaged polarization $\left< \bfS \right>_{\max}$ is
\Begineq
  \left< \bfS \right>_{\max} = \int d\bfr \, \rho(\bfr) \, \bfn(\bfr)
\Endeq
where the integral is over the beam phase space space density $\rho$ and the longitudinal
$s$-dependence is implicit. The above equation neglects any single spin polarization or
depolarization processes. Notice that what is calculated is a time averaged quantity.
Instantaneously, the beam can be fully polarized but the average over many turns, at some given
position $s$, cannot exceed $\left< \bfS \right>_{\max}$.

Another quantity that can be computed from knowledge of $\bfn$ is the equilibrium polarization of a beam
$\bfP_{dk}$ using the Derbenev-Kondratenko-Mane formula \cite{b:barber99}:
\begin{align}
  \bfP_{dk}(s) &= -\bfn(s) \, P_{dk} \\
  P_{dk} &= -\frac{8}{5 \, \sqrt{3}}
  \frac{\displaystyle \oint ds \,\left< g^3 \, \what\bfb \cdot 
    \left( \bfn - \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} \right) \right>}
  {\displaystyle \oint ds \, \left< g^3 \left( 1 - \frac{2}{9} (\bfn \cdot \what\bfs)^2 + 
    \frac{11}{18} \left| \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} \right|^2 \right) \right>}
    \nonumber
\end{align}
where $<>$ denotes an average over phase space, $g = 1/\rho$ is the bending
strength ($\rho$ is the bending radius), $\delta$ is the fractional energy deviation which, for
ultra-relativistic particles, is the same as phase space $p_z$, $\what\bfs$ is the unit vector in
the direction of motion, and $\what\bfb$ is defined to be
\Begineq
  \what\bfb \equiv \frac{\what\bfs \cross d\what\bfs/ds}{d\what\bfs/ds}
\Endeq
Notice that $\what\bfb$ is the direction of the magnetic field when $\what\bfs$ is perpendicular to
the magnetic field and when there is no electric field.

The time dependence of the polarization is \cite{b:barber99})
\Begineq
  \bfP(t) = \bfP_{dk} \, \left( 1 - \exp{-t/\tau_{dk}} \right) + \bfP_0 \, \exp{-t/\tau_{dk}}
\Endeq
where $\bfP_0$ is the initial polarization and the polarization rate $\tau_{dk}^{-1}$ is 
\Begineq
  \tau_{dk}^{-1} = \frac{5 \, \sqrt{3}}{8} \frac{r_e \, \gamma^5 \, \hbar}{m}
  \frac{1}{C} \, \oint ds \, \left< g^3 \, \left( 1 - \frac{2}{9} (\bfn \cdot \what\bfs)^2 + 
  \frac{11}{18} \left| \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} \right|^2 \right) \right>
  \label{t583}
\Endeq

$\tau_{dk}^{-1}$ can be decomposed into two parts:
\Begineq
  \tau_{dk}^{-1} = \tau_{st}^{-1} + \tau_{dep}^{-1}
  \label{tdk}
\Endeq
where $\tau_{st}^{-1}$ is the Sokolov-Ternov poarization rate given by the first two terms on the
RHS in \Eq{t583} and the depolarization rate $\tau_{dep}^{-1}$ is given by the the third term:
\Begineq
  \tau_{dep}^{-1} = \frac{5 \, \sqrt{3}}{8} \frac{r_e \, \gamma^5 \, \hbar}{m}
  \frac{1}{C} \, \oint ds \, \left< g^3 \,
  \frac{11}{18} \left| \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} \right|^2 \right>
  \label{tdep}
\Endeq

%-----------------------------------------------------------------   
\section{SLIM Formalism}
\label{s:slim}

The \vn{SLIM} formalism\cite{b:chao.spin,b:duan15,b:barber99}, indroduced by Alex Chao, is a way to
represent the linearized (that is, first order) orbital and spin transport as an $8 \cross 8$ matrix
which then can be analyzed. The idea is to expand the transport map around the closed orbit
$(\bfr_0, \bfn_0)$ where $\bfr_0$ is the orbital closed orbit and $\bfn_0$ is ``spin closed orbit''
namely the unit-vector, one-turn periodic solution of the Thomas-BMT equation on $\bfr_0$. $\bfn_0$
is just the invariant spin field on the closed orbit. The formalism provides estimates of the
equilibrium spin polarization and the rate of depolarization in electron storage rings, both under
the restriction of the aforementioned linearization. Moreover, a procedure known as spin matching,
for minimizing depolarization driven by the noise injected into synchro-betatron motion by
synchrotron radiation, and which involves optimising the layout of the ring, can be executed in a
simple and elegant way via the SLIM formalism. The formalism can also give insights into proton spin
dynamics in regimes where the linearisation suffices.

The \vn{SLIM} formalism expresses spin components using two right-hand coordinate systems:
\footnote{Different authors will use different conventions for the ordering of the axes
The ordering used here puts $\bfn_0$ second reflecting the fact that in many rings the $\bfn_0$
axis will point in the vertical $y$-direction in the arcs.}
\begin{align}
  &\big( \bfl(s), \bfn_0(s), \bfm(s) \big) 
  \qquad \text{and} \qquad \CRNO
  &\big( \bfl_0(s), \bfn_0(s), \bfm_0(s) \big)
\end{align}
The axes ${\bf l}_0(s)$ and ${\bf m}_0(s)$ are solutions of the Thomas-BMT equation on the closed
orbit and, generally, are not one-turn periodic. The axes ${\bf l}(s)$ and ${\bf m}(s)$ are chosen
to be one-turn periodic but can have an arbitrary $s$ dependence which can be chosen for convenience
otherwise. The axes ${\bf l}_0(s)$ and ${\bf m}_0(s)$ are used for spin matching and a special
choice of ${\bf l}(s)$ and ${\bf m}(s)$ is used for calculating polarization and
depolarization. With respect to these axes, a unit-length spin $\bf {{\bf S}}$ can be written as 
\begin{align}
  \bf{S} &= \sqrt{1- \alpha_0^2 - \beta_0^2} ~{\bf n}_0 + \alpha_0 \, {\bf l}_0 + \beta_0 \, {\bf m}_0 
  ~~{\rm or }~~ \CRNO
  \bf{S} &= \sqrt{1- \alpha^2 - \beta^2} ~{\bf n}_0 + \alpha \, {\bf l} + \beta \, {\bf m}
  \label{s1ab}
\end{align}
To linearize the tranport, it is assumed that $\alpha_0$, and $\beta_0$ (and hence $\alpha$, and
$\beta$) are small compaired to one. To first order, the variation from unity of the spin component
along the $\bfn_0$ axis will be second order can be ignored:
\begin{align}
  \bf{S} &\approx {\bf n}_0 + \alpha_0 \, {\bf l}_0 + \beta_0 \, {\bf m}_0 ~~{\rm or }~~ \CRNO
  \bf{S} &\approx {\bf n}_0 + \alpha \, {\bf l} + \beta \, {\bf m}
\end{align}

For spin matching, starting from the $(\bfl_0(s), \bfn_0(s), \bfm(s))$ coordinate system, the
$\bfn_0$ coordinate is dropped since the spin component along $\bfn_0$ is a constant and what is
used is the eight-dimensional spin-orbit phase space
\Begineq
  (x, p_x, y, p_y, z, p_z, \alpha_0, \beta_0)
\Endeq
where the orbital part $x, p_x$, etc. is taken with respect to the closed orbit
The first order map between two any points $s_1$ and $s_2$ is an $8 \cross 8$ matrix $\wt\bfM$ which is
written in the form
\Begineq
  \wt\bfM(s1, s2) = \begin{pmatrix}
    \bfM_{6\cross6} & \Bf 0_{6\cross2} \\
    \bfG_{2\cross6} & \bfD_{2\cross2}
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{mm0gd}
\Endeq
Where $\bfM(s_1, s_2)$ is the $6\cross6$ orbital phase space transport matrix, and $\bfG(s_1, s_2)$
contains the coupling of the spin coordinates $(\alpha_0, \beta_0)$ to the orbital motion. Because
$\bfG$ is calculated with respect to the $( {\bf l}_0, {\bf m}_0)$ axes, large spin precessions on
the closed orbit due to dipole and solenoid fields are eliminated. That leaves small precessions due
to synchro-betatron motion. The $\bfG$ matrix thus represents the dominating linear dependence of
the small precessions on the six synchro-betatron coordinates and it then provides a good framework
for analysis \cite{b:barber85,b:barber99}. In \Eq{mm0gd}, $\bfD$ is a $2\cross2$ rotation matrix
for the spin transport of a particle on the closed orbit. In this case, since the $\bfl_0(s)$ and
$\bfm_0(s)$ are solutions to the T-BMT equation, $\bfD$ is the unit matrix. The upper right block
$\Bf 0_{6\cross2}$ in the $\wt\bfM$ matrix is zero since Stern-Gerlach effects are ignored. If
$\wt\bfM$ is the 1-turn matrix ($s_2 = s_1$), the phase advance of $\bfD$ is the spin tune.

To compute $\widetilde \bfM$ for a section of the ring, the first step is to find the $6 \times 6$
orbital matrix for the section. Then $\bfn_0$ and subsequently are $\bfl_0$ and $\bfm_0$ are needed
to obtain $\bfG$.  So $\bfn_0$ at some starting point $s$ is calculated (section 18.3) and
propagated around the ring. This $\bfn_0$ is then available for calculations involving the whole
ring. If only part of the ring is being analyzed, the orientation of $\bfn_0$ at the start of the
section can be an input parameter (that is, it is given by the User and not calculated). However, to
use the $\bfG$ matrices for spin matching, it usually only makes physical sense to use the $\bfn_0$
at the start of the section to be investigated after finding $\bfn_0$ for the whole ring. After
$\bfn_0$ is known at some $s$-position, $\bfl_0$ and $\bfm_0$ at that $s$-position can be chosen
somewhat arbitrarily to form the right handed coordinate system. However it is usual to make a
special choice of the initial $\bfl_0$ and $\bfm_0$ in order to simplify the $\bfG$ matrices. After
the initial $\bfl_0$ and $\bfm_0$ axes have been specified at some initial $s$, the axes can be
transported along the closed orbit of the section.

If $\bfG$ were zero everywhere, the spin motion would be completely decoupled from the orbital
motion (at least to first order) and the depolarization rate $\tau_{dk}^{-1}$ given by \Eq{tdep}
would be zero since $\partial\bfn / \partial\delta$ would be zero. Therefore, spin matching analysis
for a section of the ring involves adjusting the parameters (quadrupole strengths, drift lengths
etc) of the section so as to minimize elements in appropriate columns of the $\bfG$ matrix and
thereby decreasing the rate of depolarization by minimizing $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ at the
dipole magnets (where $g$ in \Eq{tdep} is nonzero) \cite{b:barber99}. Such adjustments are made
while simultaneously maintaining acceptable Courant-Snyder parameters and for this the closed orbit
should be taken to be the design orbit.  This optimisation can be carried out using standard
facilities in \bmad. The calculation of $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ in the SLIM approximation is
described below.

The process for calculating electron polarization and the rate of depolarization in the \vn{SLIM}
foralism is as follows. First, the $8 \times 8$ matrix $\widetilde\bfM$ for one turn is calculated
as described above. Then, using the closed-orbit spin tune $\nu_0$, a specific version of $(\bfl,
\bfm)$ is constructed by rotating the vectors $\bfl_0$ and $ \bfm_0$ backwards around $ \bfn_0$ by
the angle $2\pi \nu_0$ in a drift space right at the end of the turn, thereby transforming
$\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ into $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and transforming the $\bfG$ matrix
correspondingly\footnote{Adding a rotation at the end is just for convenience. For some other
applications it is useful to choose axes $ \bfl$ and $ \bfm$ within which spins precess at the
constant rate with a phase advance of $2\pi \nu_0$ per turn.}. The original one-turn $\bfG$ matrix
is not one-turn periodic but the transformed $\bfG$ matrix is one-turn periodic and the matrix
$\bfD$ for one turn becomes the $2 \times 2$ rotation matrix with rotation angle $2\pi \nu_0$
\cite{b:chao.spin}.  The new matrix $\widetilde \bfM$ is then also one-turn periodic and its
eigenvectors are used as described after \Eq{qvw} for calculating the derivative ${\partial
\bfn}/\partial \delta$ used in \Eq{tdep}.  For this, note that if the elements in appropriate
columns of the non-periodic $\bfG$ matrix for one turn map at a dipole have been minimized by spin
matching, the corresponding elements of the periodic one-turn $\bfG$ matrix have been minimized
too. Then, via \Eqs{wdlgv} and \eq{ndaw} $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ has been minimized as
required.

In contrast to the approach in \cite{b:barber85,b:barber99}, \bmad calculates the $\bfG$ and $\bfD$
matrices from the quaternion of the spin transport map (which \bmad calculates via PTC
(\sref{c:ptc})).  After the $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$ coordinates have been calculated (or set by
the User) at some initial point, the axes can be transported using the $\bfq_0$ quaternion
(\Eq{qqrq}). When analyzing only a section of a ring, there is no identifiable spin tune so nothing
further needs to be done. In this case, the $\bfD$ matrix is just a unit matrix. When analyzing an
entire ring, it is sometimes desireable to rotate the $\bfl_0(s)$ and $\bfm_0(s)$ axes to give a
uniform phase advance as a function of $s$.  When analyzing one-turn maps, it is generally not
necessary to rotate the $\bfl_0(s)$ and $\bfm_0(s)$ axes. In this case the spin phase advance as a
function of $s$ will be zero except just before the starting position where there will be a
discontinuous jump in phase.

Once the $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$ coordinates have been calculated, the matrices $\bfG$ and $\bfD$
can be calculated from the spin transport map (which \bmad calculates via PTC (\sref{c:ptc})). To
first order, the spin transport map $\bfq_s(s1, s2)$ from $s1$ to $s2$ represented as a
quaternion, can be written in the form
\Begineq
  \bfq_s = \bfq_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^6 r_i \, \bfq_i
  \label{qqrq}
\Endeq
The quaternion $\bfq_0$ is the zeroth order part of the map (the spin rotation for a particle on the
closed orbit) and the six quaternions $\bfq_i$, $i = 1, \ldots, 6$ are the first order part with
$\bfr$ being the orbital phase space point at $s1$ the map is being evaluated at. Let
$\bfq_{lnm}(s)$ be the quaternion that transforms from $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$\footnote{Or
eqivalently, these formulas work with the $(\bfl, \bfn_0, \bfm)$} coordinates to $(x, y, z)$
coordinates at a given point $s$. With this, the spin transport $\what\bfq$ from $s_1$ to $s_2$ in
the $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$ coordinate system is
\Begineq
  \what\bfq_s(s_1, s_2) = \bfq_{lnm}(s_2) \, \bfq_s(s_1, s_2) \, \bfq_{lnm}^{-1}(s_1)
\Endeq
The zeroth order part of this map 
\Begineq
  \what\bfq_0(s_1,s_2) = \bfq_{lnm}(s_2) \, \bfq_0(s_1, s_2) \, \bfq_{lnm}^{-1}(s_1) 
\Endeq
represents a rotation around the $\bfn_0$ axis. 

To calculate the $\bfD$ matrix, $\what\bfq_0$ is converted into a rotation matrix $\bfR_0$ via
\Eq{rqqq}) the $\Bf D$ matrix is then
\Begineq
  \Bf D(s_1, s_2) = \begin{pmatrix}
      R_0(1,1) & R_0(1,3) \\
      R_0(3,1) & R_0(3,3)
  \end{pmatrix}
\Endeq
In particular, with $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$, $\widehat \bfq_0$ represents the identity ($\equiv
(1, 0, 0, 0)$) and $\bfD$ is a unit matrix as expected.

The rows of the $\bfG$ matrix encode the first-order dependence of the changes of the angles
$\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ (or of the angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$).  The $\bfG$ matrix can therefore
be calulated from $\what\bfq_i$ which is the first order part of $\what\bfq_s$
\Begineq
  \what\bfq_i = \bfq_{lnm}(s_2) \, \bfq_i(s_1, s_2) \, \bfq_{lnm}^{-1}(s_1)
\Endeq
Using \Eq{qqrq} in \Eq{rqqq} and keeping only first order terms gives
\begin{align}
  \bfG(1,j) &= 2 (\what q_{0,x} \, \what q_{j,y} + \what q_{0,y} \, \what q_{j,x} + 
                  \what q_{0,1} \, \what q_{j,z} + \what q_{0,z} \, \what q_{j,1}) \\
  \bfG(2,j) &= 2 (\what q_{0,1} \, \what q_{j,x} + \what q_{0,x} \, \what q_{j,1} + 
                  \what q_{0,y} \, \what q_{j,z} + \what q_{0,z} \, \what q_{j,y}),
  \quad j = 1, \ldots, 6
  \nonumber
\end{align}
[Do not be confused by the $x$, $y$ and $z$ subscripts which refer to the components of $\what q$
as definded in \Eq{qqqqq}. $\what q$ rotates spins in the $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$ coordinate system.
Not the $(x, y, z)$ coordinate system.]

The derivative ${\partial\bfn}/\partial\delta$ is calculated from the eigenvectors of the
one-turn-periodic $8 \times 8$ matrix $\widetilde \bfM$ for one turn (\Eq{mm0gd}) as shown in
\cite{b:barber99}.  The eigenvectors $\bfu_j$ and eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ ($j = 1, \ldots 8$) of
$\widetilde \bfM$ are computed first. These eigenvectors are of the form
\begin{align}
  \bfu_j &= \begin{pmatrix} \bfv_j \\ \bfw_j \end{pmatrix}, \quad j = 1, \ldots, 6 
  \label{qvw} \\
  \bfu_j &= \begin{pmatrix} \Bf 0_6 \\ \bfw_j \end{pmatrix}, \quad j = 7, 8 \nonumber
\end{align}
where $\bfv_j$ are eigenvectors of the orbital submatrix $\bfM$, and the $\bfw_j$ are computed via
\Begineq
  \bfw_j = -\left[ \bfD - \lambda_j \, \bfI_2 \right]^{-1} \bfG \, \bfv_j
  \label{wdlgv}
\Endeq
where $\bfI_2$ is the $2 \times 2$ unit matrix. These eigenvectors, computed at the chosen starting
point, $s1$ are propagated to other $s$-positions $s2$ with ${\widetilde \bfM}(s1, s2)$.  Then
${\partial \bfn}/\partial \delta$ can be computed at each $s$-position via
\Begineq
  \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} = \sum_{j = 1}^6 A_j \, \bfw_j
  \label{ndaw}
\Endeq
and the $A_j$ are computed by inverting the equation
\Begineq
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]^t = \sum_{j = 1}^6 A_j \, \bfv_j
  \label{000001}
\Endeq
where the superscript $t$ means transpose.

As an alternative to using \Eqs{ndaw} and \eq{000001}, the usual way given in the literature is to first
normalize the eigenvectors via \cite{b:chao79}
\Begineq
  \bfv_j^{*t} \, \bfS \bfv_j = i, \quad j = 1, 3, 5
  \label{vsvi}
\Endeq
where the eigenvectors have been arranged in complex conjugate pairs with $\bfv_{j+1} = \bfv_j^*, \,
j = 1, 3, 5$ with the superscript $*$ denoting the complex conjugate. In \Eq{vsvi} $\bfS$ is the matrix
\Begineq
  \bfS = \begin{pmatrix}
      0 & -1 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
      1 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
      0 &  0 &  0 & -1 &  0 &  0 \\
      0 &  0 &  1 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
      0 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 & -1 \\
      0 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  1 &  0 \\
  \end{pmatrix}
\Endeq
With this, ${\partial \bfn}/{\partial \delta}$ is computed via
\Begineq
  \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} = i \, \sum_{j = 1}^6 \bfv_{j5}^* \, \bfw_j
  \label{ndivw}
\Endeq
From a computational standpoint, the advantage of \Eq{000001} over \Eq{ndivw} is that \Eq{000001}
can be used even if there are no synchrotron oscillations (no RF cavities) where the energy is a
constant of the motion and the $\bfM$ orbital matrix has degenerate eigenvectors which prevent the
normalization condition \Eq{vsvi} from being used.

\section{Spinor Notation}

The following descibes the old spinor representation used by \bmad to represent spins. This
documentation is kept as an aid for comparison with the spin tracking literature.

In the SU(2) representation, a spin $\Bf s$ is written as a spinor $\Psi = \left( \psi_{1}, \psi_{2}
\right)^{T}$ where $\psi_{1,2}$ are complex numbers. The conversion between SU(2) and SO(3) is
\Begineq  
  \Bf S = \Psi^{\dagger} \Bf {\bfsig} \, \Psi 
  \qquad \longleftrightarrow \qquad
  \Psi  = \frac{e^{i \xi}}{\sqrt{2 \left(P+s_{3}\right)}}   
     \begin{pmatrix} P+s_{3} \\ s_{1}+i s_{2} \end{pmatrix}   
  \Endeq  
Where $\xi$ is an unmeasureable phase factor, and $P$ is the polarization. $P = 1$ for a single
particle. Also ${\bfsig} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)$ are the three Pauli matrices
\Begineq
  \sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &  1 \\ 1 &  0 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad
  \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i &  0 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad
  \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &  0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\Endeq
In polar coordinates
\Begineq   
  \Psi = \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{1} \\ \psi_{2} \end{pmatrix}
       = \sqrt{P} \, e^{i \xi}
         \begin{pmatrix} 
            \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \\   
            e^{i \phi} \, \sin \frac{\theta}{2}
         \end{pmatrix}
  \qquad \longleftrightarrow \qquad
  \Bf S = P \, \begin{pmatrix} \sin \theta \cos \phi \\   
                          \sin \theta \sin \phi \\   
                          \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}
  \label{pp1p2}
\Endeq
Due to the unitarity of the spin vector,   
$|\psi_{1}|^{2} + |\psi_{2}|^{2} = P$.
The spinor eigenvectors along the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes are
\begin{align}
   \Psi_{x+} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \, , 
  &\Psi_{x-} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \, , \CRNO
   \Psi_{y+} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{pmatrix} \, , 
  &\Psi_{y-} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{pmatrix} \, , \\
   \Psi_{z+} &=                       \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \, , 
  &\Psi_{z-} &=                       \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \, . \nonumber
\end{align}

In spinor notation, the T-BMT equation can be written as
  \Begineq   
    \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \Psi = - \frac{i}{2} \left( \bfsig \dotproduct   
    {\pmb\Omega} \right) \Psi = -\frac{i}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
    \Omega_z & \Omega_x - i \, \Omega_y \\
    \Omega_x + i \, \Omega_y & -\Omega_z \end{pmatrix}
    \Psi
  \Endeq   
The solution leads to a rotation of the spin vector by an angle   
$\alpha$ around a unit vector $\bfhat n$ represented as   
  \begin{align}   
    \Psi_f &= \exp \left[ -i \frac{\alpha}{2} \bfhat n \dotproduct \bfsig \right] \Psi_i \CRNO
         &= \left[ \cos \left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right) \, \Bf 1_{2} - 
            i \, (\bfhat n \dotproduct \bfsig) \, \sin \left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right) \right] \Psi_i \\
         &= \Bf A \Psi_i. \nonumber
  \end{align}   
where $\Psi_i$ is the initial spin state, $\Psi_f$ is the final spin state, and $\Bf A$,
which describes the spin transport, is the SU(2) matrix representation of the quaternian
$(a_0, \Bf a) = (\cos(\alpha/2), -\sin(\alpha/2) \, \bfhat n)$. $\Bf A$ has the
normalization condition $a_{0}^{2} + \boldsymbol{a}^{2} = 1$. Thus the three components
$\boldsymbol{a} = \left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}\right)$ completely describe $\Bf A$. 

With spinors, the matrix representation of the observable $S_{\Bf u}$
corresponding to the measurement of the spin along the unit vector
$\Bf u$ is
\begin{align}
  S_{\Bf u} &\equiv \frac{\hbar}{2} \, \bfsig \dotproduct \Bf u \\   
            &= \frac{\hbar}{2} 
                   \begin{pmatrix} 
                     u_z            & u_x - i \, u_y \\
                     u_x + i \, u_y & u_z
                   \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
The expectation value of this operator, $\Psi^\dagger \, \Bf S_u \,
\Psi$, representing the spin of a particle, satisfies the equation of
motion of a classical spin vector in the particle's instantaneous rest
frame.

For a distribution of spins, the polarization $P_s$ along the unit
vector $\Bf u$ is defined as the absolute value of the average
expectation value of the spin over all N particles times
$\frac{2}{\hbar}$,
  \Begineq
    P_s = \frac{2}{\hbar} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \Psi_j^\dagger S_{\Bf u} \Psi_j
  \Endeq  

See \S~\sref{s:spin.hard.fringe} for formulas for tracking a spin through a multipole
fring field.
