To speed up the initialization process, you can make an init file for the GUI.  This file should be called "gui.init", and it should be placed in your home directory.  If you want to use a different name/location, start the gui with the command
$ python3 $GUI -gui_init path/to/your/init/file

gui.init should have each option on a separate line, and each option should be listed in the form "parameter:value".  For example, the text below would constitute a good gui.init file:

#MY GUI INIT FILE
beam_file:/path/to/beam/file
data_file:/path/to/data/file
#THIS IS A COMMENT
disable_smooth_line_calc:T
rf_on:T
tao_exe:/path/to/executable

The order in which you list options in gui.init is not important.

File paths should be specified in full to be safe, but you can specify paths relative to the directory from which you launch main.py.  For example, "/home/username/file", "subfolder/my_file", and "../../path/to/another/file" would all be acceptable file paths.  You can also use your environmental variables and "~", as in "~/Documents/my_file" and "$DIST_BASE_DIR/tao/file".

Logic (true/false) options may be specified by T/F or True/False.

You can also include comments with #.  Any line with # as its first non-whitespace character will be considered a comment and ignored.
