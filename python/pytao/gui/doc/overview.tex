\chapter{Overview}

\tao is an open source general purpose program for charged particle and X-ray simulations in
accelerators and storage rings. It is built on top of the \bmad toolkit (software library) which
provides the needed computational routines needed to do simulations. Essentially you can think of
\tao as a car and \bmad as the engine that powers the car. In fact \bmad powers a number of other
simulation programs but that is getting outside of the scope of this manual. 

Documention for \bmad and \tao, as well as information for downloading the code if needed is given
on the \bmad web page
