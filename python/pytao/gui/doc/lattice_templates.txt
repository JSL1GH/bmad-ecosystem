You can save your settings from the lattice table window in a template file, which can then be loaded and added to from within the gui.
The file can be named anything, and the formatting is as follows:
Lines starting with # are considered comments and ignored.
Lines starting with "name:" are interpreted as a name for the settings listed in the line directly below
All other lines are interpreted as switches, as would be used with the show lattice command in Tao (see the tao manual for more info).
All switches for a given template should be on one line.

Example:
#MY TEMPLATE FILE
name:template 1
-orbit -spin -tracking_elements
name:template 2
-lords q*
name: another template
-floor_coords -s 10:20
-radiation_integrals -all

This template file defines four templates: "template 1", "template 2", "another template", and an unnamed template (which has the switches -radiation_integrals -all).  Named templates are displayed by name in the gui, while unnamed templates are simply displayed by what switches they specify.
