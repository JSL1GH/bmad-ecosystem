Known Translation Limitations:

CAVI: 
  Translated to rfcavity. Therefore does not handle accelerating cavities.
  Parameters not translated: 
		V1, V20, V11, V02
		DISFRIN, FRINGE
    DPHI

Misalignments in SOL element with GEO = 1 not yet implemented.

A given MARK element with a non-zero offset cannot appear multiple times in a lattice.
This is due to the fact that the corresponding Bmad element uses superposition.

Conversion cannot handle the same mult element appearing two different
places in the lattice when the solenoid field is different in these
different places.

MULT elements cannot have a finite bending angle nor can a MULT element have
an RF field.

---------------------------
What to do if translation fails:

Multiple "use" statements may confuse the translator. Remove unused use statements in case of trouble.

"Action" commands, that is, commands that modify the lattice (EG optimizing lattice parameters) cannot
be translated. In fact, these statements may confuse the translator. Remove action commands in case 
of trouble.

If all else fails, or if you want to generate a lattice that has been modified by SAD (EG SAD has
been used to optimize lattice parameters), you can use SAD to generate a lattice file that is
easily converted. Add this to your SAD lattice file:

fout=OpenWrite["new.sad"];
FFS["OUTPUT "//fout//" TYPE"];
WriteBeamLine[fout,Format->"MAIN",Name->{"XXX"}];
Write[fout," FSHIFT = "//FSHIFT//";"];
Write[fout," MOMENTUM = "//MOMENTUM//";"];
Write[fout," USE XXX;"];
Close[fout];

Here "XXX" should be replaced by the name of the line to use.
The one disadvanteage in doing this is that all parameters are evaluated 
and so varialbes used in the original file are lost.
