Known Translation Limitations:

CAVI: 
  Translated to rfcavity. Therefore does not handle accelerating cavities.
  Not translated: V1, V20, V11, V02
  Not translated: DISFRIN, FRINGE
  Not translated: DPHI

Misalignments in SOL element with GEO = 1 not yet implemented.

Conversion cannot handle lines that contain sub-lines.

A given MARK element with a non-zero offset cannot appear multiple times in a lattice.
This is due to the fact that the corresponding Bmad element uses superposition.
