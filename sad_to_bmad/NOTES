Known Translation Limitations:

CAVI: 
  Translated to rfcavity. Therefore does not handle accelerating cavities.
  Not translated: V1, V20, V11, V02
  Not translated: DISFRIN, FRINGE
  Not translated: DPHI

Misalignments in SOL element with GEO = 1 not yet implemented.

Conversion cannot handle lines that contain sub-lines.

A given MARK element with a non-zero offset cannot appear multiple times in a lattice.
This is due to the fact that the corresponding Bmad element uses superposition.

Conversion cannot handle the same mult element appearing two different
places in the lattice when the solenoid field is different in these
different places.

Thoughts:

Use SAD program to create lattice file.
