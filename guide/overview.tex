\section*{Overview}

\bmad\ (Otherwise known as "Baby MAD" or "Better MAD" or just plain "BE MAD!")
is a software subroutine library used for relativistic
charged--particle dynamics simulations in high energy accelerators and
storage rings. \bmad\ can be used to read in lattice files, compute
Twiss parameters, track particles, etc.  The \bmad\ subroutines, written in
Fortran90, have been developed to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cut down on the time needed to develop programs,
\item Cut down on programming errors, and
\item Provide a standard input format for specifying lattices.
\end{enumerate}
\bmad\ has been developed at Cornell University's Laboratory for Elementary
Particle Physics and has been in use since the 1990's.
