\SECTION{Overview}

\bmad\ (Otherwise known as ``Baby MAD" or ``Better MAD" or just 
plain ``Be MAD!")  is a software subroutine library used for
relativistic charged--particle dynamics simulations in high energy
accelerators and storage rings. The \bmad\ subroutines, written in
Fortran90, have been developed to:
\begin{Itemize}
\item Cut down on the time needed to develop programs,
\item Cut down on programming errors, and
\item Provide a standard input format for specifying lattices.
\end{Itemize}

\bmad\ can be used to study single and multi--particle beam dynamics. Its 
features include the ability to track particles, calculate transfer matrices,
emittances, Twiss parameters, 
dispersion, coupling, etc. The elements that \bmad\ knows about include
quadrupoles, RF cavities (both storage ring and LINAC accelerating types),
solenoids, dipole bends, etc. 

\bmad\ has been developed at Cornell University's Laboratory for Elementary
Particle Physics and has been in use since the 1990's. This manual is part of the 
\bmad\ software distribution but it can also be obtained from the web at
