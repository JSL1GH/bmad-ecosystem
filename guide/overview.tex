\SECTION{Overview}

\bmad\ (Otherwise known as ``Baby MAD" or ``Better MAD" or just plain
``Be MAD!")  is a software subroutine library used for relativistic
charged--particle dynamics simulations in high energy accelerators and
storage rings. \bmad\ has been developed at Cornell University's
Laboratory for Elementary Particle Physics and has been in use since the
1990's. \bmad\ was developed because there was a need at Cornell to do
calculations that couldn't be done with existing programs in general use
in the accelerator physics community. What had been hapening 
was that individual physicists were writing programs almost from scratch 
to do individual calculations. This lead to much duplication of effert.
Since it was time consuming to write simulations, needed calculations where
not being done. As a response the \bmad\ subroutines, written in
Fortran90, were developed to:
\begin{Itemize}
\item Cut down on the time needed to develop programs,
\item Reduce computation times to a minimum,
\item Cut down on programming errors, 
\item Provide a simple means with which one can do lattice calculations 
from within programs (control system or otherwise),
\item Provide a standard input format for specifying lattices, and
\item Provide a standardized means to share lattice information between 
programs.
\end{Itemize}

\bmad\ can be used to study single and multi--particle beam dynamics.
\bmad\ has the ability to track both particles and macroparticles with
wakefields and radiation excitation and damping. \bmad\ has routines for
calculating transfer matrices, emittances, Twiss parameters, dispersion,
coupling, etc., etc. The elements that \bmad\ knows about include
quadrupoles, RF cavities (both storage ring and LINAC accelerating
types), solenoids, dipole bends, etc. In addition \bmad\ has the feature
that elements can be defined to control the attributes of other
elements. This can be used, for example, to simulate the action of
control room ``knobs'' where a control room knob may vary the strengths
of multiple magnets in the accelerator. Other possibilities include
the simulation of I--beams that determine the position of multiple
element.
