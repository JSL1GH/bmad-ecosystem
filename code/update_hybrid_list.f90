! Subroutine update_hybrid_list (lat, n_in, keep_ele, keep_overlays_and_groups)
!
! Subroutine to add elements to the keep_ele list needed by the routine
! make_hybrid_lat.
!
! Keep_ele is a list of elements that should appear in the hybridized lattice. 
! This list is used by the subroutine make_hybrid_lat. If an element is to be
! kept (not hybridized) then the associated lord and slave elements need
! to be also added to the keep_ele list. This routine does that bookkeeping
! for a single element keep_ele(n_in).
!
! Modules needed:
!   use bmad
!
! Input:
!   lat  -- lat_struct: Input lat structure.
!   n_in -- Integer: keep_ele(n_in) is the element whose associated lord and
!             slave elements are to be added to keep_ele.
!   keep_overlays_and_groups
!        -- Logical, optional: If present and False then overlay and group elements
!             are kept. Default is True.
!
! Output:
!   keep_ele(:) -- Logical: list of lat elements to be not hybridized.
!                   This is used with make_hybrid_lat.
