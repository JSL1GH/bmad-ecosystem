# NOTE: This script is dual-purpose and it's behvaior is determined by the
#       name of the symlink used to invoke it!
#
# Purpose:
# Run a build for a type determined by the name of the script invoked.
# The actual name of this script is 'mk-mkd', depending on the name of
# the symlink used to invoke it, different behavior is triggered.
#   invoking 'mk' causes a production build
#            'mkd' causes a debug build
#
# This reduces overhead and potential confusion as there 
# is only one script to maintain.
#
# Arguments:
#  Command-line arguments passed to this script are handed off to the
#  gmake invocation that executes the builder generated by the
#  cmake pass immediately prior.
#  This allows for 
#        mk[mkd] clean  -to clean the build and output trees
#                         of object, library, and executables files.
#
#        mk[mkd] cleaner  -removes all bin/lib/module files in the current
#                          project production/debug directory tree and the 
#                          upper level production/debug directory tree 
#                        
#        mk[mkd] obliterate  -removes ALL bin/lib/module files for ALL 
#                             projects in ALL production/debug directories.
#                             PLEASE USE WISELY!
